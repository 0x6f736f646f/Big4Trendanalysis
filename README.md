# ORACLE DATA SCIENCE HACKATHON
At the beginning of the second term, the President of the Republic of Kenya, Uhuru Kenyatta, outlined four pillars thaat would be the government's agenda in his final five years in office The four pillars are:
* Manufacturing
* Affordable housing
* Universal health coverage
* Food security

Your task is to collect data from social media and use it to gauge Kenyans attitude towards the presidents's Big Four Agenda in general, and the individual pillars in particular. Find out their sentiments towards the initiative and whether there are areas they are more or less positive about. The end result will be a presentation where you must convince the judges that the agenda is or isn't supported by the people, which pillar has the most support and which has the least support.
